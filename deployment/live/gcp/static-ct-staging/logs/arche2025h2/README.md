# Arche2025h1 staging log

## Overview

This config uses the [gcp/tesseract/cloudrun](/deployment/modules/gcp/tesseract/cloudrun) module to
run TesseraCT on Cloud Run, backed by Trillian Tessera and preloaded with argon2025h1 entries.

### Update the roots
Run the following command from the root of the repository.

It fetches roots from argon2025h1, and filters out roots that don't parse with `crypto/x509` and `internal/lax509`.
As of 2025-03-21, these roots are:
- https://crt.sh/?id=298, with a negative serial number
- https://crt.sh/?id=9027356, affected by https://github.com/golang/go/issues/69463.

```
go run github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/client/ctclient@master get-roots --log_uri=https://ct.googleapis.com/logs/us1/argon2025h1/ --text=false | \

### Automatic Deployment
This GCP SCTFE preloaded staging environment is designed to be deployed by the Cloud Build ([Terraform module](/deployment/modules/gcp/cloudbuild/tesseract/), [Terragrunt configuration](/deployment/live/gcp/static-ct-staging/cloudbuild/arche2025h1/)).

### Manual Deployment
TODO(phboneff): come back to this, Cloud Run doesn't trigger a deployment if the tag does not change value.

First authenticate via `gcloud` as a principle with sufficient ACLs for
the project:

```sh
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Set the required environment variables:

```sh
export GOOGLE_PROJECT={VALUE}
export GOOGLE_REGION={VALUE} # e.g: us-central1
unset TESSERA_BASE_NAME
```

You need an Artifact Registry repository to store container images; adapt the configs and commands below to use your registry of choice. The rest of these instructions assume that the repository is hosted on GCP, and called `${GOOGLE_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${GOOGLE_PROJECT}/docker-staging`. For reference, here's a [terraform module](/deployment/modules/gcp/artifactregistry/) you can use to set up such a registry.

Build and push the Docker image to Artifact Registry repository:

```sh
gcloud auth configure-docker ${GOOGLE_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev
docker build -f ./cmd/gcp/Dockerfile -t tesseract-gcp:latest .
docker build -f ./cmd/gcp/staging/Dockerfile -t conformance-gcp:latest .
docker tag conformance-gcp:latest ${GOOGLE_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${GOOGLE_PROJECT}/docker-staging/conformance-gcp:latest
docker push ${GOOGLE_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${GOOGLE_PROJECT}/docker-staging/conformance-gcp
```

Terraforming the project can be done by:
  1. `cd` to [/deployment/live/gcp/static-ct-staging/logs/arche2025h1/](/deployment/live/gcp/static-ct-staging/logs/arche2025h1/).
  2. Run `terragrunt apply`.

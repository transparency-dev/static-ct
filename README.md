This personality implements [Static CT API](https://c2sp.org/static-ct-api) 
using [Trillian Tessera](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tessera) 
to store data. It is based on 
[Trillian's CTFE](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/tree/master/trillian/ctfe).

It is under active development.

## Deployment
Each Tessera storage backend needs its own TesseraCT binary.

At the moment, these storage backends are supported:

 - [GCP](./cmd/gcp/): [deployment instructions](./deployment/live/gcp/test/)
 - [AWS](./cmd/aws/): [deployment instructions](./deployment/live/aws/test/)
 - more to come soon!
